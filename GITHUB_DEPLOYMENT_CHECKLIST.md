## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Review
- [ ] Review all changes for sensitive data
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify environment variable usage
- [ ] Check for any remaining hardcoded values

### 2. Repository Setup
- [ ] Create new GitHub repository
- [ ] Push code to repository
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure issue templates (optional)

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with correct repository URL
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Test setup instructions
- [ ] Add license file

### 4. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create production Supabase project
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure production authentication
- [ ] Test production deployment

## üîß Post-Deployment

### For Users
- [ ] Users can clone the repository
- [ ] Users can follow setup instructions
- [ ] Users can create their own Supabase project
- [ ] Users can configure their own environment variables

### For Contributors
- [ ] Code is properly documented
- [ ] TypeScript types are complete
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- All sensitive configuration is externalized
- Authentication is properly implemented
- Database access is secured with RLS
- File uploads are validated
- No secrets are committed to the repository

## üìù Additional Recommendations

1. **Add a LICENSE file** - Choose appropriate license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
2. **Add CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors
3. **Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community guidelines
4. **Set up GitHub Actions** - For CI/CD and testing
5. **Add issue templates** - For bug reports and feature requests
6. **Add pull request templates** - For code review guidelines
